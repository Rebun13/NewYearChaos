# NewYearChaos

## Description

It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue from _1_ to _n_. Any person can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions, but they still wear their original sticker. One person can bribe at most two others.

Determine the minimum number of bribes to get to a given queue order. Print the number of bribes, or, if anyone has bribed more than two people, print Too chaotic.

## Returns

- No value is returned. Print the minimum number of bribes necessary or Too chaotic if someone has bribed more than _2_ people.

## Input

The first line contains an integer _t_, the number of test cases.
Each of the next _t_ pairs of lines are as follows:
- The first line contains an integer _t_, the number of people in the queue
- The second line has _n_ space-separated integers describing the final state of the queue.
